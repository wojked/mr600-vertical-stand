# Quite generic router vertical stand

This stand should fit most of the routers.

I did it for TP-Link Archer MR600 V2, however by just adjusting ROUTER_THICKNESS you should be able to generate a matching stand (with Customizer's WEB UI or just use OpenSCAD).

HINT: Start with small DEPTH values and try to mount your router. 
Iteratively adjust to get the best fit.

You can decide if you want to print a thicker, single stand or few thinner ones (better if the router has a rounded shape)
